# Stochastic_Optimal_Control_Market_Making

The limit order book (LOB) containing high-frequency data for Amazon over a 1-day period was used to calibrate a market making algorithm. To remove the noise of the high-frequency data and get an accurate measure of the running volatility, the two-scaled realized volatility (TSRV) subsampling technique was used. 

The optimal bid-ask spread was calculated using Hamiltonian-Jacobian-Bellman (HJB) equation where the diffusion of the stock price was stochastic volatility with 0 drift. That is:
$$dS_t = \sqrt{\nu_t} dW_t$$
$$d\nu_t = \kappa(\bar{\nu} - \nu_t)dt + \eta \sqrt{\nu_t}dB_t$$
where $W_t$ and $B_t$ are brownian motions with correlation $\rho$.
The cash process used:
$$dX_t = (S_t + \delta^a)dN_t^a - (S_t - \delta^b)dN_t^b$$
$$dq_t = dN^b_t - dN^a_t$$
where $N_t$ is a poisson random variable given by the arrival of the market orders (MO), and $q_t$ is the inventory.

The utility function used was:
$$\mathbb{E}\left[-e^{-\gamma\left(X_T+q_T S_T-lq_T^2\right)}\right]$$

That is, we are punished for holding inventory at the end of the trading day.

Then using Bellman's principle of optimality:
$$U(t, X) = \sup_{\delta_t \in \mathcal{A}(t, X)} \{ \mathbb{E}^{t, X} \left[ \int_t^\theta L(s, X_s, \delta_s) \, ds + U(\theta, X_\theta) \right] \}$$

And applying Ito's lemma, we get the resultant HJB:

with terminal condition, $V(T, q, \nu, X, S)=-e^{-\gamma(X+q S-\kappa q^2)}$

To reduce the dimensions, we use the ansatz solution:
$$V(t, q, \nu, X, S)=-e^{-\gamma(X+q S)} U(t, q, \nu)$$
which gives the resultant HJB:

To solve the HJB PDE, the Thomas Algorithm was implemented, and the optimal bid and ask spreads were calibrated to be:

Then using these optimal quotes, backtests were ran to test the efficacy. At time $t$ set bid and ask quotes given current volatility $\nu_t$ and inventory $q$. Then at time $t+1$, the stock price $S_t$ and volatility $\nu_t$, evolve according to their SDEs. If the price hits the bid or ask, a 1 unit trade is executed (we do not requote until a pre-defined period, it's why in the figure below was have flat lines for the quotes).
